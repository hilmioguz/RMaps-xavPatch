RMaps-xavPatch is a fork from RMaps project (http://robertdeveloper.blogspot.fr/2009/08/rmaps.html).

### Why fork RMaps ?
Because RMaps does not seem maintained (last release : 0.9.4.1 on Jan 13, 2014, last commit : Jan 18, 2014). And, on recents Android devices, there is two main issues :
 - The android Menu button has disappeared.
 - On device screen with hight ppi (Pixels per inch), text on the map is too small (street name...) : for exemple LG G3 : 1440 x 2560, ppi: 538

This fork patch the version 0.9.4.1 (svn revision r703) for have an application without these two problems.
